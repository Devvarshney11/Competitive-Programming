// ðŸŒŸ Sliding Window "At Most to Equal" trick
// NOTE: this is an extension to my "C++ Maximum Sliding Window Cheatsheet Template!". Please make sure you are familiar with this template first.

// For problems solvable using this trick, also check out "C++ Maximum Sliding Window Cheatsheet Template!"

// For a find maximum sliding window problem that is looking for windows with exactly k something in it, we can convert it to a problem that is looking for at most k something in it.

// It's because "number of windows with exactly k something in it" = "number of windows with at most k something in it" - "number of windows with at most k - 1 something in it".
